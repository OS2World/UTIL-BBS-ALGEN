               ALGEN v1.21 - the Avail List / ALlfiles GENerator
                      Copyright 1992-93 by Richard Butler

ALGEN is an Avail List / Allfiles generator for FILES.BBS systems. ALGEN is an
OS/2 2.x application and will not run under DOS. The source code and make file
are available as ALSRC121.LZH. ALGEN was compiled using IBM C SET++ in C mode.

ALGEN CARRIES NO WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF FITNESS AND MERCHANTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE
INFORMATION IN THIS DOCUMENT AND INCLUDED SOFTWARE.

In other words, it's not guaranteed to do anything :-)

ALGEN is FreeWare and requires no registration fee.

If you use ALGEN please send me netmail at 1:396/61 and let me know. The more
netmail I get the more work I'll do on ALGEN.

ALGEN was originally created to be an OS/2 clone of Harvey Parisien's HLIST.
Any similarities between ALGEN and HLIST are completely intentional. There
have been many changes due to user suggestions, but if anything in ALGEN even
vaguely resembles something in HLIST then credit for it goes to Harvey. If you
need a DOS based file list generator I would highly recommend HLIST.

ALGEN configuration file:
-------------------------

ALGEN now uses a keyword type configuration file. It was changed to make it
easier to add new features and because I hate command line switches.

        KEYWORDS                DESCRIPTION
        --------                -----------

        System                  Your system name

        NewDays                 Days old to qualify as NEW files. Default
                                is 14. ALGEN uses the Last Write Date for
                                all file dates.

        FileList                The path and name for the output FILE LIST
                                ie. C:\BBSUTIL\EUROPAFL.LST
                                (required)

        NewFileList             The path and name for the output NEW FILE
                                LIST. ie. C:\BBSUTIL\NEWFILES.LST
                                (optional)

        Header                  The path and name of your header file that
                                will appear at the top of your FILE LIST.
                                ie. C:\BBSUTIL\ALGEN.HDR
                                (optional)

        NewHeader               The path and name of your header file that
                                will appear at the top of your NEW FILE LIST.
                                ie. C:\BBSUTIL\NEW.HDR
                                (optional)

        StripFlags              This tells ALGEN not to include flags found
                                at the beginning of a file description in
                                the output lists. ie. Maximus's /tb flag.
                                It functions the same way that Maximus does,
                                if the first character is a /, the / and
                                everthing following it, up to and including
                                the first space, is not displayed in the
                                output.

        NoIBMchars              This tells ALGEN not to use IBM characters
                                for borders and area headers.

        AreaInclude             Begins with the keyword AREAINCLUDE and ends
                                with the keyword END. Contains 1 line per
                                area you have a files.bbs file on and want
                                ALGEN to process. The data is in this format...

                                drive:\path\ YOUR TITLE TEXT

                                If you want to use a different file list other
                                than the normal files.bbs (ie for cd rom use),
                                just put the complete path and filename after
                                your title but separate it with a carat like
                                this...

                    drive:\path\ YOUR TITLE TEXT^drive:\path\files_bbs_name.ext

        MaxAreas                This tells ALGEN to use your Maximus AREA.DAT
                                file. It should be followed by the path and
                                filename. ie MaxAreas C:\MAX\AREA.DAT

        AreaExclude             Begins with the keyword AREAEXCLUDE and ends
                                with the keyword END. Each line will contain
                                one area name (as defined in your Maximus
                                Filearea.Ctl) that you wish to exclude from
                                your file list.

        ShowMaxNames            This tells ALGEN to include Maximus's area
                                name in the file area descriptions.

        NoEmptyAreas            This tells ALGEN not to include empty file
                                areas in your FILE LIST and NEW FILE LIST.

        Indent                  Number of spaces to indent each description
                                line after the first one. This is useful if
                                you use d/l counters. Default is 0. Max is 16.

        ShowSummary             This tells ALGEN to include summary information
                                for your file areas at the end of your
                                FILE LIST and NEW FILE LIST.

        UseFIDX                 This tells ALGEN to use Maximus's FILES.IDX and
                                FILES.DAT to find file sizes and file dates.
                                This should speed things up for use with cd rom
                                since ALGEN wil not have to access the cd rom.

        IgnoreBadDates          This tells ALGEN to ignore file dates > todays
                                date when determining whether a file is new.


Lines in your config file prefaced by a ; are considered comments.

You can tell ALGEN to use an alternate config file by including it on the
command line like so:

ALGEN Other.Cfg

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALGEN treats any line in your FILES.BBS that begins with a - or a space as a
comment and copies it exactly as it appears to the output file list. No word
wrapping is done on comment lines.

ALGEN will preserve the case of filenames. ALGEN does not support long file
names at this time since most files.bbs systems do not support long file names.

ALGEN now supports paths in your FILES.BBS.

HISTORY
---------
v0.2b  - First beta release.
         Compiled with GNU 2.1. Requires EMX.DLL to run.

v0.3b  - Second beta release.
         Compiled with C SET/2 v1.0. No longer requires EMX.DLL.
         Fixed bug that caused (stored offline) to be put in the file list
         when a blank line was read from files.bbs.
         Added the option to use a different file other than the normal
         files.bbs for use with cd rom.

v0.4b  - Third beta release.
         Released mere minutes after v0.3b :-)
         Fixed bug that used the files last access date instead of the last
         modified date.

v1.00  - First general release.
         Hopefully bug free.

v1.01  - Bug fix.
         Fixed the 'V6TRUNC' grunged date bug.

v1.02b - Beta release.
         Changed the config file to a keyword type config file to make it
         easier for future additions.
         Added NoIBMchars option.
         Added NewHeader option for the NEW FILE LIST.
         Minor cosmetic changes to the output file lists.

v1.03b - Beta release.
         Added support for Maximus's Area.Dat.
         Increased the size of the input buffer to allow ALGEN to properly
         handle Maximus's maximum length file description.

v1.04b - Beta release.
         Now creates file lists as a temporary file and then renames them.
         Added ShowMaxNames option.
         Added NoEmptyAreas option for the NEW FILE LIST.

v1.05b - Beta release.
         Fixed an errant error message that occurred when not generating a
         NEW FILE LIST.

v1.10  - Second general release.

v1.11b - Beta release.
         Added Indent option for d/l counters.
         Discovered new Link386 options :-) Algen is now smaller and maybe
         even a little faster.

v1.12b - Beta release.
         Changed word-wrap routines. ALGEN was stripping spaces from d/l
         counters (and anything else with more than one space).

v1.13b - Beta release.
         Fixed bug in NEW FILE LIST.

v1.14b - Beta release.
         Changed DosFindFirst() to DosQueryPathInfo(). I'm told that this
         should speed things up a little.
         NoEmptyAreas now applies to the FILE LIST as well as the
         NEW FILE LIST.

v1.15  - Third general release.

v1.16b - Beta release.
         Increased number of file areas that ALGEN can process from 256 to 512.
         Changed config file parsing routines to properly handle tabs.

v1.17b - Beta release.
         Added support for paths in files.bbs.

v1.18á - Beta release.
         Added ShowSummary option.
         Added support for Maximus's FILES.IDX and FILES.DAT.
         ALGEN can now process an unlimited number of file areas.
         ALGEN now opens all Maximus files (AREA.DAT, FILES.BBS, FILES.IDX,
         FILES.DAT) in OPEN_ACCESS_READONLY | OPEN_SHARE_DENYNONE mode.

v1.19á - Beta release.
         Compiled with IBM C SET++ in C mode.
         Fixed an exception bug.
         Added IgnoreBadDates option.

v1.20  - Fourth general release.

v1.21  - Bug Fix.
         Fixed problem with optional config items not being optional.
